    <h2>BLM Chicago Protest</h2>

    <p>The United States had just watched the murder of George Floyd on national TV. People were extremely angry and fed up with the injustice the police is responsible for. The day began pretty peaceful but it clearly did not end that way. This day will forever be etched into my memory.
