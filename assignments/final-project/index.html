            <p>My name is Fabian Uribe and I am a photographer, but then again who isn't? Anyways I have been photographing for the last 10 years and I consider myself pretty adaptable to situations. What happened on May 30, 2020 rocked my world. 
            </p>
            <p>It all began on a warm summer Saturday in May. The weather was gorgeous and all I wanted to do was to spend my day out in nature. I packed my gear and went down to Starved Rock to photograph the waterfalls with my wife. We were having a great day, enjoying the fresh air and a great  bite to eat. While we waited for our food I jumped on my phone and realized that a BLM protest was schedule to take place in downtown chicago later on in the day.  </p>
            <p>I asked my wife if she would like to go and support the BLM movement and she agreed. Not going to lie, it surprised me that she wanted to go, but her pull to her culture was really hitting strong. We packed our car again and drove 3 hours into the city to support the movement. </p>
            <p>What happened next is something that I have had a hard time processing. In fact, this is the first time I have ever shown or really talked about the day. Check out my collection of photos that paint a picture of my day.</p>
