            <h3>Grave Digger</h3>
            <p>Originally built out of an old 1951 Chevy Panel Wagon and parts that were scrounged from junkyards,Dennis Anderson created the most exciting monster truck of all time.The paint scheme, which combines green flames, letters dripping blood, a foggy graveyard scene with tombstones bearing names of competitors, a haunted house silhouetted by a full moon, and a giant skull-shaped ghost, Grave Digger is considered one of the most famous and recognized monster trucks of all time. This truck is straight up menacing. </p>

            <h3>Dennis Anderson</h3>
            <p>"I'll take this old junk and dig you a grave with it." Dennis Anderson, a four-time World Champion, created the iconic Grave Digger in 1982 and became a fixture on monster truck racing circuits. He pushed the Digger to the max night in and night out, and entertained thousands at a time. In freestyle events he would try what others wouldnt or probably couldn't, and in the racing circuit he would win or crash.  Anderson has some big cajones, flips, rolls, crashes, this man is a walking living legend.
